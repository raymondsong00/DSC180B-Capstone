step_by_step_inspection_checklist = '''Step 1 Airway:
Check trachea position, carina angle (60â€“100 degrees), and main stem bronchi.
Look for tubes, pacemaker wires, lines, and foreign bodies. Ensure correct positioning of endotracheal tubes.

Step 2 Bones and Soft Tissues:
Assess clavicles, ribs, thoracic spine, and humerus for fractures or lesions.
Examine soft tissues for subcutaneous air, foreign bodies, and surgical clips.
Be cautious of nipple shadows; compare both sides.

Step 3 Cardiac:
Evaluate heart size, borders, and for pneumomediastinum.
Inspect aorta for widening or calcification, heart valves, and major veins.

Step 4 Diaphragm:
Compare right to left hemidiaphragm height. Consider effusion or paralysis if discrepancies are noted.
Check for free air under the diaphragm in upright positions.

Step 5 Effusion:
Look for blunting of costophrenic angles and fissure tracking.
Examine pleura for thickening, loculations, calcifications, and pneumothorax.

Step 6 Lung Fields:
Identify infiltrates, noting their location and pattern (interstitial vs. alveolar).
Look for air bronchograms, tram tracking, nodules, Kerley B lines, and assess apices.

Step 7 Gastric Air Bubble:
Verify position, check for hiatus hernia, free air, and misplaced bowel loops.

Step 8 Hilum:
Evaluate position, size, lymph nodes, calcified nodules, mass lesions, and pulmonary artery size.
